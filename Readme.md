# Hackathon- computer vision
Welcome to our Hackathon-2023. Through this hackathon we are trying to select interns have passion to work in computer vision and deep learning. You can select either C++/Python to solve these coding assignments. Best of luck everyone  

* Use issues to ask any queries 

* Only make use you use the images given in the dataset rather than using any other public images. That is if a problem has limited dataset that is a constraint and you have to develop a algorithm optimal with respect to the constraint 

## Problem 1. 
Write an algorithm that will detect the defect in the images given below. Breakup of the mark is as given below
** Expecting a general algorithm that works for different diameter, transaltions during image acquisiton etc . 

* Flowchart - 20 marks
  
* Basic algorithm to find defects - 40 marks
  
* Localizing the defect - 20
  
* Classify the defect to flashes and cut marks - 20
  
### Good Image

### Defective Images
1. Flashes

2. Cuts

* Refer dataset 1 folder

## Problem:2 
In manufacturing companies the production lines are optimised for creating good samples while defective samples are very hard to generate and will happen only once in a while. To adress this issue we have to develop quality inspection system from golden samples. In this problem we have given a train dataset of a screw where good samples conists of 2 screws of different length and 4 nuts. Design a anomaly model which can detect both logical and structural changes in the data

* Refer the datset2 folder 

## Problem 3 
 A footwear company requires to detect the size mismatch of the their pair of footwear(that is sometimes the operator will place two different sizes as a pair ). Select a method to solve this poroblem. The dataset is given as [dataset](https://dhvani365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/nithin_v_dhvaniai_com/EvY9yo7sFJxMpconseQHcJ4B1HUHReaLYtmeHwF6orIXnQ?e=VwqeqA)
